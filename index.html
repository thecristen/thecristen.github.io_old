<h2>The Biography of Cristen Jones</h2>

Hello there!
Sometimes I make things that are three-dimensional. But usually, my output is quite flat.

<p>I like to create websites. Starting from teaching myself HTML in the early 2000s, now I'm generating pages with Ruby like a madwoman (this place). Front-end web development is a thing now, and recently it became not just my hobby, but my job. Currently, I work with an interesting little web app developing startup in Boston.
Currently, I tinker with web design and user experience with a little creative Boston-based software engineering startup. </p>

<p>I like to write. And I think all writers like to read.</p>

<p>How has technology affected my life? well, I'd be here..</p>

<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>Well, the little picture at the upper left and its associated favicon are mine. As are the art works linked. No takey.</p>

<p>This website template is a modified version of <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/lagom/">Lagom</a>. I built this website using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the Ruby-based static site generator (according to <a href="http://yeswejekyll.com">this page</a>, even Obama used it! <small>Though maybe that's not such a good compliment anymore</small>). I liked the idea of hosting all my own content (which I do on <a href="https://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=cristen">Webfaction</a>), and I got sick of scouring the Internet for clean, simple Wordpress themes. Building it this way also allowed me to gain some new skills!</p>
