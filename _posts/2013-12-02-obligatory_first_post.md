I've lost track of how many "first posts" I've written over the years. This one feels especially nice to write though, because I'm writing this blog post without sending it through a CMS like Wordpress, or Tumblr, or Livejournal, and somehow that feels liberating to me. 

As long as my server *and* computer *and* Github stay in service, I'll always have my data? You don't say!

This is also my first "first" post since I've become a professional. Oddly enough, I'm a professional front-end designer/hacker now (but I don't build personal sites there). I learned a lot while building this site but hopefully I won't be inspired to build another one for awhile!

### Some details for front-end web nerds

This website's template is a modified version of [Lagom](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/lagom/). I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the Ruby-based static site generator (according to [this page](http://yeswejekyll.com), even Obama used it! Though maybe that's not such a good compliment anymore). I liked the idea of hosting all my own content (which I do on [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=cristen)), and I was sick of scouring the Internet for clean, simple Wordpress themes. 

I'm more of a designer than a developer (...maybe), so it's great to get such fine control over the templating. The tradeoff, I suppose, is writing way more Ruby than I ever wanted to, but I'm pretty happy with the result.

If you find something broken and it really bothers you, feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/thecristen/thewebsite/issues) on Github.

###Onward!

I'm still learning Markdown (which I need to use to write these posts now), but I'm using a desktop app called [Mou](http://mouapp.com) to provide me with a handy live preview while I attempt to type properly. I'll be adding content over the coming days until I feel all caught up. 

(Anyone else hate that it's called **content**? The word feels so empty; it makes me shudder.)
