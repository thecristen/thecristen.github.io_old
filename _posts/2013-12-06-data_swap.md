Data Swap is a Boston-based initiative by [The Globe Lab](http://lab.bostonglobe.com/) where teams of individuals with diverse skills and backgrounds from research, government, and civic organizations get to work on complex problems with large-scale datasets. My team focuses on data records of all incoming and outgoing sea trade within our borders.
