I'm about to text a friend. My finger is thisclose to pressing the auto-filled name so that I can start typing my message, and then I hesitate.

This horrible sinking feeling is reminding me that if I press, the phone will pull up our messaging history. Then I'll have to see the one-sided text-heavy screen and face the fact that my last 3 or 4 messages have been ignored, and so why in the hell am I still trying?

My first thought was *ugh, this is dumb who cares*. First-world anxious-people problems.

My second thought was wow, if I were doing this on something other than a smartphone, I'd have no clue that my last few messages were ignored, and it wouldn't be on my mind, and I wouldn't be feeling anything right now! 

For example, I could send an email, where starting a new thread gives me a clean slate. Same with making a phone call, or even running into someone and starting a conversation there. We could start talking in a way that's relatively free from the context of previous exchanges.

Some things I use are designed against that. Facebook messages, Twitter DMs, instant messaging services that show your chat history upon opening - by default they frame your conversation as a single linear stream, even though it may contain fragmented pieces and disparate contexts. Presenting every single interaction in a reverse-chronological stream is all good and fun I guess, until you want to bury a thing here or there.

Facing the past sometimes can be much more irksome than forgetting it. This isn't the first time that some software design decision has reminded me that.  Hrrmmm.
