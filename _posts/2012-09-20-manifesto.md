I am a civic social entrepreneur. I'm interested in fixing how we interact with government in order to improve our lives and the world we inhabit. I'm particularly interested in helping populations that are currently systematically underserved by our society and its systems.

Additionally, I strive for clear, compelling communication. I believe in data and in its ability to shine light on truth.

### Aspirations

I want to see the government both give and take fairly.

I want to get money out of politics.
