## The backstory of Cristen

Hello there! I'm Cristen.

I like to create websites, and recently it became not just my hobby, but my job.  Currently, I tinker with web design and user experience with a little creative Boston-based software engineering startup. I'm from New York City but for now live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with my husband [Andrew](http://andrew3.thejonesgroup.org). 

Previously, I've mapped things, parsed big datasets, built data visualizations, interviewed public officials and even [blogged for pay](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/cristen). I studied building technology and urban studies while at MIT, and I have a Master in Regional Planning from Cornell. 

You can say that I enjoy learning how the world works in a very tangible, concrete sense. Dealing with fun questions such as *"Why do so many more people die at this street corner than that other nearby street corner?"* and *"How do we build structures that both withstand nature and angry citizens?"*

## Life is UX

I believe that how we experience life is mostly influenced by how all aspects of life are intentionally (or accidentally) designed. For example, we know where to cross a street because the placement of interesting things drives foot traffic and because someone decided to paint white lines in certain places. 

However, people are not perfect and history leaves its scars within today's everyday life. I want to question why society is the way it is, and figure out how I can influence our world in a positive way through my talents and the various forms of privilege bestowed upon me. 

Ha ha, very original, I know.

So basically, that's who I am and what I'm doing. I'll track my adventures here on this website. Until next time!
