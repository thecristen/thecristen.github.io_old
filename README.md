This is just  my personal website. Also serves as a learning exercise, since this is my first Jekyll-powered website, my first time deploying to Github Pages, etc.

It's quite a learning adventure. After about a day of experimenting, I've come to a few key decisions regarding how I'll deploy and maintain this site:

- Because GitHub Pages runs Jekyll in safe mode, I can't use any of Jekyll's awesome plugins. This makes me sad because I really want to pimp out this site. Therefore I'm going to ditch hosting via GitHub Pages.
- No more gh-pages means no using Prose.io. It's a neat app though. Using it to edit this README right now
- Back to one branch! Having both a master branch and a gh-pages branch was a confusing pain in the neck.
